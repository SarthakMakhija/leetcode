### Problem

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of
the nodes in the tree.

```
Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

```
Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```


`Follow up (Pending)`: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find
the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
