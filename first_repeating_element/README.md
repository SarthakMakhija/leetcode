### Problem

Given an array arr[] of size n, find the first repeating element. The element should occurs more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.

```
Example 1:

Input:
n = 7
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Output: 2

Explanation:
5 is appearing twice and its first appearence is at index 2
which is less than 3 whose first occuring index is 3.
```

```
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: -1

Explanation:
All elements appear only once so answer is -1.
