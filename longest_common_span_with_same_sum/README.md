### Problem

Longest Span in two Binary Arrays.

Given two binary arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of same size N. Find length of the longest common span [i, j] where j>=i such that arr1[i] + arr1[i+1] + …. + arr1[j] = arr2[i] + arr2[i+1] + …. + arr2[j].

```
Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Arr1[] = {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0}
Arr2[] = {1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1}
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest span with same sum is from index 1 to 4 following zero
based indexing.
