### Problem

Given a binary matrix your task is to find all unique rows of the given matrix.

```
Example 1:

Input:
row = 3, col = 4
M[][] = {{1 1 0 1},{1 0 0 1},{1 1 0 1}}
Output: 1 1 0 1 $1 0 0 1 $

Explanation: Above the matrix of size 3x4
looks like
1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1
The two unique rows are 1 1 0 1 and
1 0 0 1 .
