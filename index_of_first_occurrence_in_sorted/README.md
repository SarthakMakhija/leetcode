Given a sorted array arr containing n elements with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find index of first occurrence of an element x in the given array.

```
Example 1:

Input:
n=9, x=5
arr[] = { 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125 }
Output:  2 5

Explanation: First occurrence of 5 is at index 2 and last
occurrence of 5 is at index 5.
```

```
Example 2:

Input:
n=9, x=7
arr[] = { 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 123, 125 }
